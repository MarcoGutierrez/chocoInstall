# chocoInstall
This is a template for making chocolatey silent installers

I found the directions online to be quite verbose and decided to make my own. So in this so far I have included
 a template of how to make your own installer with lines commented on where to make changes and a 7zip
 installer that I made using said template.

 Please feel free to use this template, I do not have a license but as I do not own Chocolatey I cannot stop you from using it.
